          <p className="mb-12">
            Firstly, we will make sure the user's computer has remote access by going to "ThisPC", right-clicking for properties, going to remote settings, and
            using helpdesk or admin credentials if required. Next, we will check “allow remote connections” and allow remote desktop connection on the helpdesk
            computer and type in the computer on the server that you are trying to connect to. If you can't open the remote desktop application go to the user's
            computer's command line, type "ipconfig /flushdns" and retry. You will be logged in as yourself but in control of someone's computer. Go to
            "ThisPC", users, click the user of interest, and hit continue. Now you can add stuff, or mess with account directories/folders. You can also mess
            with apps by adding "\appdata\" to the user account path.
          </p>
          <h3 className="bg-white mt-12">Remote Registry</h3>
          <p className="mb-12">
            In the helpdesk computer, go to the start menu, windows administration tools, and open Registry Editor. You may have to enable remote administration
            for Registry. In that case, go to the user's computer, open their start menu, type "services" and run the services app as administrator. Next,
            double-click the Remote Access Connection Manager, run, and do the same with Remote Registry. Set the startup type as automatic, hit apply, start,
            and then ok. Go back to the helpdesk computer and in Registry Editor click the file dropdown, select "Connect network registry", and then type the
            user's computer name in. Be careful not to break the whole computer from the Registry! Something neat you can do here is go to Network and see if
            shared drives are there.

          <p className="mb-12">
            Open Windows Remote Assistance to help someone who has invited you. Go into the computer you are trying to remote into, go to File Explorer,
            right-click "ThisPC", click manage, go to groups, remote desktop users, and see if the helpdesk account is there. Next, go to "invite someone to
            connect to your PC and help you" from the start menu. Invite someone to help you and save this invitation as a file on the desktop. Go back to the
            helpdesk computer, and press use an invitation file. Remote into computer with c$ with c$\\&#123;computername\&#125; in file explorer, go to users,
            &#123;user account&#125;, desktop, and open invitation file. The password to remote into the user's computer is given by the user.

            see IPV4. Change the name of the Windows 10 computer to something like desktop1. Install Chrome, search TeamViewer, and install. Ping to Windows
            Server 2016 IPV4 address. Hit Control Panel and View Network Status. Change adapter settings, select ethernet, and go to properties. Assign static

            response. Go to "ThisPC", right-click to select properties, change settings, select change, select domain, put the server's domain name, and then
            sign in with an Admin or Helpdesk account. After all this, restart. Check if desktop1 was added to the server by going to Active Directory and
            clicking Computers. Use a user account with administrative/helpdesk privileges through "Other user" on Windows 10 so we use a
            domain/server-connected account &#40;not a local account&#41;. Check if you have RSAT tools and Server Manager from that account. From here, if you
            want, you can pin Active Directory &#40;AD&#41; to the Windows taskbar.

            the local port, add a new printer using an existing port: and hit next. Install a new driver and click next. Select the printer name, uncheck "share
            this printer" and click next until finished. Right-click the new printer, go to properties, and go to the sharing tab. From here you can select the

            earlier you selected to list the printer in the directory, you can go to Active Directory, right-click domain, and search for the printer and find
            it. To check if a printer can be added on a user's desktop go to the control panel, view devices and printers, add printer, select the printer you
            want to add, hit next, and finish. Check the properties of the printer if needed at this point. To troubleshoot printer access/drivers go to server

            and ok. Next, go to properties, click advanced, click new drivers to update drivers, and re-list in the directory after. It should be noted that
            cloud printer services are an easier option than this. If a company is looking for simple printer solutions, cloud printer services should be in
            consideration.
